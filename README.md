U-Hackathon project --Human Activity Recognition in Video using Smart CCTV System<br>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
Absence of a surveillance system that detects inappropriate activity, through the CCTV cameras, and automatically sends an alert<br>notification to the concerned authorities.<br> 
Development of an efficient ‘human posture recognition software’ for the security authentication systems, that are being used currently.<br>
<h3>Our Solution:<h3>
  <h2>Project ‘Netra’</h2>
<br>Our team has designed an AI based Surveillance-System which captures the movements and posture of individuals and deploys machine<br> learning algorithms on them. With the help of this dataset the system maps out a certain pattern and then compares it with predefined <br>patterns of human activity like sitting, standing, running etc.  Moreover, it analyzes the activity in process and alerts the concerned<br> authorities if some abnormal activity is found.<br>
